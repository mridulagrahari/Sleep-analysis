# Sleep-analysis
💤 Sleep Analysis Project
📌 Overview
This project delves into the analysis of sleep patterns using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to uncover insights into factors affecting sleep quality and duration, employing data analysis and visualization techniques.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset

Description: The dataset encompasses various attributes related to individuals' sleep health.




🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved:

Assessing data quality and handling missing values

Analyzing distributions of key variables

Exploring correlations between features

Visualizing relationships using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps

Sample Visualization:


🔍 Key Findings
Individuals with higher physical activity levels tend to report better sleep quality.

Stress levels are inversely related to sleep quality.

Certain occupations, such as students, exhibit irregular sleep patterns.
